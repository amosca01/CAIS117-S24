this high falling into your ocean eyes those ocean eyesso i just wanted to say something real quick which is yesterday i was at kimmel which was amazing and when i left i had to go to a rehearsal so to walk to the car there was an alley that i walked through like 500 feet to my left was a group of fans and then like 500 feet to my right was what i thought was fans and paparazzi  i started i went to the left side i walked all the way over to them and hugged them all i took pictures and talked to them for a second didnt sign anything because i like dont do that thats something i dont do because i used to and i realised all anyone did was sell everything that i signed so i stopped doing that its kind of a policy of mine that i dont  so i talked to them hugged them all i went to the other side and as i got closer like they were cheering for me and stuff and shouting for my name and stuff and so i walked  and as i got closer i kind of realised that it was pretty much all paparazzi and ebayers which is what we call people that just take my signature and sell it and couldnt give less of a fuck about me at all  but i didnt want to like be disrespectful at all so i went up to them all and i like tried to get like hugs and try to touch all of their hands like do that down the line or whatever and i started to do that nobody put their hands out nobody tried to hug me backi hugged one girl at the end and so she was really sweet  but then i tried to walk like a couple feet across from where they were not where the first group was but like in the same area that i was in because i thought thats where there were fans  when i looked over there they were gone and i was like ok well i guess nobody here really wants anything from me besides a fucking autograph which i dont do because these bitches will sell that shit  like ill sign something if its like for a special occasion or if somebodys in need or whatever of course im gonna do that but i have this whole thing about not signing things because i just want to be there id way rather get a hug and talk to you than take a picture with you and fucking sign something so you can sell that shit  i dont do that and ive tried to make that clear like a billion times  and i said it before i went over to them  anyway  i started to walk away because i realised none of these people actually cared about anything that had to do with me as a person um and so i walked away  as i started to walk away back to the car they all started to boo me  and then they all started calling me a little bitch and saying im gonna lose my grammy nominations and you know what a little fucking you know whatever just cursing me out and shit  damn dude like  then i started hearing them comparing they kept being like lorde would have stopped im like i did stop i walked 500 fe i walked like 000 feet to come say hi to you and give some hugs and yall are booing me and calling me a little bitch  like the fact that people can switch up like that clicks fingersdamn like wait outside for you and then immediately they dont get what they want and they boo you and fucking curse at you  im like bro im 7 youre  oh my god this shit isexasperated whoo i turned around ready to fucking pounce and then i got told to just ignore it and not give a reaction which is probably good and its probably stupid dumb of me making these videos but  mmanyway the only reason im making this video is because i saw a video of this all happening and i just wanted to clarify what actually happened because if you watch the video it literally looks like im watching by a bunch of fans and like completely ignoring them and not saying hi to them which is not at all what happened  i literally walked from the other side of the alley which was like 000 feet which is fine im like happy to do it but i walked over there literally only to say hi only to hug people i literally went over and i was like i dont want pictures i want to hug and i got pictures of me shoved into my fucking face and no love whatsoever  so i left and then i got booed and got called a little bitch and got told that im gonna lose my grammys  i probably am gonna lose the grammys but its okay though im not worried about that its the nomination that counts  anyway i dont know i just wanted to i dont even knowi went back to the other side where the real fans were and i was like guys they booed me and they were very sweet you guys are my friends i love you a lot  and to the grown men that booed me and called me a little bitch i hope the best for you i hope you can find someone else you can use to make money off of and belittle so yeah all the best  love you paparazziive been watching you for some time cant stop staring at those ocean eyes burning cities and
