Scene
1Synopsis:At
his
court,
Orsino,
sick
with
love
for
the
Lady
Olivia,
learns
from
his
messenger
that
she
is
grieving
for
her
dead
brother
and
refuses
to
be
seen
for
seven
years.Enter
Orsino,
Duke
of
Illyria,
Curio,
and
other
Lords,with
Musicians
playing.ORSINO
If
music
be
the
food
of
love,
play
on.Give
me
excess
of
it,
that,
surfeiting,The
appetite
may
sicken
and
so
die.That
strain
again!
It
had
a
dying
fall.O,
it
came
o’er
my
ear
like
the
sweet
soundThat
breathes
upon
a
bank
of
violets,Stealing
and
giving
odor.
Enough;
no
more.’Tis
not
so
sweet
now
as
it
was
before.O
spirit
of
love,
how
quick
and
fresh
art
thou,That,
notwithstanding
thy
capacityReceiveth
as
the
sea,
naught
enters
there,Of
what
validity
and
pitch
soe’er,But
falls
into
abatement
and
low
priceEven
in
a
minute.
So
full
of
shapes
is
fancyThat
it
alone
is
high
fantastical.CURIO
Will
you
go
hunt,
my
lord?ORSINO

What,
Curio?CURIO

The
hart.ORSINO
Why,
so
I
do,
the
noblest
that
I
have.O,
when
mine
eyes
did
see
Olivia
first,Methought
she
purged
the
air
of
pestilence.That
instant
was
I
turned
into
a
hart,And
my
desires,
like
fell
and
cruel
hounds,E’er
since
pursue
me.Enter
Valentine.How
now,
what
news
from
her?VALENTINE
So
please
my
lord,
I
might
not
be
admitted,But
from
her
handmaid
do
return
this
answer:The
element
itself,
till
seven
years’
heat,Shall
not
behold
her
face
at
ample
view,But
like
a
cloistress
she
will
veilèd
walk,And
water
once
a
day
her
chamber
roundWith
eye-offending
brine—all
this
to
seasonA
brother’s
dead
love,
which
she
would
keep
freshAnd
lasting
in
her
sad
remembrance.ORSINO
O,
she
that
hath
a
heart
of
that
fine
frameTo
pay
this
debt
of
love
but
to
a
brother,How
will
she
love
when
the
rich
golden
shaftHath
killed
the
flock
of
all
affections
elseThat
live
in
her;
when
liver,
brain,
and
heart,These
sovereign
thrones,
are
all
supplied,
and
filledHer
sweet
perfections
with
one
self
king!Away
before
me
to
sweet
beds
of
flowers!Love
thoughts
lie
rich
when
canopied
with
bowers.They
exit.
